The idea of a python coding session at lunchtime has been floating around the office for a few weeks now. The gist is that we pick a non-work related project (something fun), and spend a lunchtime discussing it, playing with code, and problem-solving. This won't necessarily be a weekly scheduled thing, as I don't want to add another commitment to people's diaries. Hence the social list - this is a lunchtime thing. Py&#.

Josh has set up a git repository (see below) and people can dip in and out as they please. We'll also get useful practice using git as a group-work tool for developing project code.

The first mini-project we're going to have a go at is this one: https://www.datacamp.com/projects/132
This involves looking at some death reports from the London cholera outbreak of 1854 (festive!), and locating a contaminated water pump using file-read and visualization methods.
